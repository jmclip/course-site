## Overview

* Introduce supervised text classification
* Implement a `tidymodels` workflow using text features
* Define topic modeling
* Explain Latent Dirichlet allocation and how this process works
* Demonstrate how to use LDA to recover topic structure from an unknown set of topics
* Identify methods for selecting the appropriate parameter for $k$

## Before class

- Read [Supervised classification with text data](/notes/supervised-text-classification/)
    - For greater depth of coverage, read [Classification](https://smltar.com/mlclassification.html) in *Supervised Machine Learning for Text Analysis in R*
- Read chapter 6 in [*Tidy Text Mining with R*](http://tidytextmining.com/)
    - [Topic modeling](/notes/topic-modeling/) from the lecture notes demonstrates how to implement this in a (semi)-tidy workflow
