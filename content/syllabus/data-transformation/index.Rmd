## Overview

* Identify computer programming as a form of problem solving
* Practice decomposing an analytical goal into a set of discrete, computational tasks
* Identify the verbs for a language of data manipulation
* Clarify confusing aspects of data transformation from [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html)
* Practice transforming data

## Before class

* Read Chapters 5-6 from [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)

## Class materials

* [Computer programming as a form of problem solving](/notes/problem-solving/)
* [`dplyr` in brief](/notes/dplyr/)
* [Practice transforming college education (data)](/notes/transform-college/)

## Additional resources

* [Data Wrangling with `dplyr` and `tidyr` Cheat Sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf)

## What you need to do after class

* Complete your peer evaluations for homework 01. Review the following:
    * [General Homework Rubric](/faq/homework-evaluations/)
    * [Performing peer review](/faq/peer-evaluations/)
    * To find which peers you will evaluate:
        * Navigate to the [course organization page on GitHub](https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/cis-fa22)
        * Find the `hw01` repos you can see that are not your own repo
        * Open the repos and find the pull request. You can then initiate a [code review](https://github.com/features/code-review) to leave detailed feedback.
