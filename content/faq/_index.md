## General description

This course is open to any graduate (or advanced undergraduate) at Cornell. I anticipate drawing students from a wide range of departments such as Information Science, Sociology, Psychology, and Political Science. Typically these students are looking to learn basic computational and analytic skills they can apply to master's projects or dissertation research.

If you have never programmed before or don't even know what the [shell](/setup/shell/) is, **prepare for a shock**. This class will prove to be immensely beneficial if you stick with it, but that will require you to commit for the full semester. I do not presume any prior programming experience, so everyone starts from the same knowledge level. I guarantee that the first few weeks and assignments will be rough - but the good news is that they will be rough for everyone! Your classmates are struggling with you and you can lean on one another to get through the worst part of the learning curve.

A highly selective sampling of feedback from when I taught [a similar course at the University of Chicago](https://cfss.uchicago.edu):

> I think this class is really well-organized. The homework is craftily designed as a way to solidify the materials learned in class. Dr. Soltoff is wonderful and helpful! He came to class fully prepared and made the lectures enjoyable and productive. I suggest that all Ph.D. students in Political Science (at least in my field), who likes to conduct quantitative research, should choose this class in the first year, because this class can well set students up with a good understanding of programming techniques.

> Very useful material that I hated learning until 2/3 through the quarter.

> This class can set you up really nicely with conversant knowledge in R programming and a large amount of coding materials that are helpful for future research. And it also provides students with a first-hand experience of using some of the cutting edge methods and makes students have a taste of them.

> I'm so so so glad I ended up taking this course. I had a lot of doubts about my own (lack of) skills and my inability to to handle so many things in one quarter. I had a lot of apprehensions about this course but they all quickly disappeared. It's quite honestly been one of the most valuable courses I've taken at this University and I attribute all of that to your excellence as a lecturer. You and the TAs have always been extremely accessible to everyone and I can't appreciate that enough. In other classes, I would've been more hesitant to ask "dumb questions" but you all have made me comfortable doing so, and I have benefited immensely from it.

> I feel like every time I have a question or want to participate, I am always acknowledged. I also built a strong relationship with my classmates which is crucial for some of the difficult assignments.

## What do I need for this course?

**You will need to bring a computer to class each day.** Class sessions are a mix of lecture, demonstration, and live coding. It is essential to have a computer so you can follow along and complete the exercises.

### Resources for under-represented groups in programming



Thanks to [Angela Li](https://angela-li.github.io/) for compiling these recommendations.



* [R LGBTQ Twitter](https://twitter.com/r_lgbtq): Affinity group for queer people in the R community -- Twitter often promotes events, panels and talks by and for queer R users. 
* [Gayta Science Twitter](https://twitter.com/gaytascience): Alliance that uses data science techniques to give LGBTQ+ experiences a voice -- Twitter will often share data-driven work concerning the LGBTQ+ community. 
* [RLadies Community Slack](http://bit.ly/rladies-slack): A global programming meetup for non-binary, trans, and female R users. 
* [RLadies Remote Twitter](https://twitter.com/RLadiesRemote): Remote chapter of R Ladies -- has Slack coffee chats to discuss programming topics in a supportive environment.

## Software

By the end of the first week (or even better, before the course starts), you should make sure you can access the following software:

* [R](https://www.r-project.org/) - easiest approach is to select [a pre-compiled binary appropriate for your operating system](https://cran.rstudio.com/).
* [RStudio's IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/) - this is a powerful user interface for programming in R. You could use base R, but you would regret it.
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - Git is a [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) which is used to manage projects and track changes in computer files. Once installed, it can be integrated into RStudio to manage your course assignments and other projects.

Comprehensive instructions for downloading and setting up this software can be found [here](/setup/).

## How will I be evaluated?

Students will complete a series of (roughly) weekly programming assignments linked to class materials. These assignments will generally be due the following week prior to Monday's class. While students are encouraged to assist one another in debugging programs and solving problems in these assignments, it is imperative students also learn how to do this for themselves. That is, **students need to understand, write, and submit their own work.**

Each homework will be evaluated by either myself or a TA, as well as by **two peer reviewers**. Each of you is required to provide two peer reviews for each assignment; failure to complete these reviews will result in a deduction of your final grade.

* [General guidelines for submitting homework](/faq/homework-guidelines/)
* [Evaluation criteria for homework](/faq/homework-evaluations/)
* [How to perform peer review](/faq/peer-evaluations/)
* [How to properly ask for help](/faq/asking-questions/)

## Academic integrity

Each student in this course is expected to abide by the [Cornell University Code of Academic Integrity](https://theuniversityfaculty.cornell.edu/dean/academic-integrity/). Under the provisions of the Code, anyone who gives or receives unauthorized assistance in the preparation of work at home or during tests in class will be subject to disciplinary action. A student's name on any piece of work is our assurance that they have neither given nor received any unauthorized help in its preparation. Students may assist each other on assignments by answering questions and explaining various concepts. However, one student should not allow another student to copy their work directly. All University policies with respect to cheating will be enforced. A student who is found to have cheated on an exam, or any other graded assignment, will receive an “F” in the course.
