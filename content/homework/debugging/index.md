# Overview

Due by 11:59pm on October 4th.

# Accessing the `hw05` repository

Go [here](https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/cis-fa22) and find your copy of the `hw05` repository. It follows the naming convention `hw05-<USERNAME>`. Clone the repository to your computer.

# Debugging code

The repository contains an R script called `babynames.R`. This script includes code to conduct analysis of baby name popularity in the United States using the [`babynames`](http://hadley.github.io/babynames/) package. Alas its author made some mistakes and the script currently does not work. Fix the errors/warnings in the script to generate the desired output.

# Submit the assignment

Your assignment should be submitted as the revised `babynames.R`.

Follow instructions on [homework workflow](/faq/homework-guidelines/#homework-workflow).

# Rubric

Needs improvement: The R script has not been successfully fixed.

Satisfactory: Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow. Nothing spectacular, either bad or good.

Excellent: Repository contains a detailed `README.md` explaining how the files in the repo should be executed. Code incorporates appropriate warnings or messages where useful.
